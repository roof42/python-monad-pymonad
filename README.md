# Functional Programming Concepts in Python (PyCon Thatiland 2023 Talk)
Welcome to my talk in PyCon Thatiland 2023 which is about Functional Programming Concepts in Python! üêç

## Concepts
- Arity: Understanding the number of arguments a function takes.
- Function Composition: Combining two or more functions to create a new function.
- Monads: Exploring this powerful design pattern in functional programming.
- Single Responsibility Principle: Why a function should do one thing well.
- Higher-Order Functions: Leveraging functions as first-class citizens.
Feel free to explore the code examples and dive deeper into these functional programming concepts. Contributions, feedback, and questions are highly encouraged! Let‚Äôs embrace the functional paradigm and write Python code that‚Äôs both efficient and expressive.
